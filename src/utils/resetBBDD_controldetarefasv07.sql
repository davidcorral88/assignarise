-- This file is provided for future database modifications
-- Currently, no database changes are needed for the category and project fields implementation
-- The existing task table already supports these fields as they are optional text fields

-- If you need to modify the database schema in the future, add your SQL statements here
-- Example of what might be needed (NOT REQUIRED FOR THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION):
--
-- ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS category VARCHAR(255);
-- ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS project VARCHAR(255);
--
-- Note: The above statements are just examples and are not needed as the fields already exist
