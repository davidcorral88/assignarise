 * This is a temporary utility to update role references from 'manager' to 'director'
 * 
 * It should be run once to update all files and then can be removed.
 * 
 * For files that are not directly available in this session, use this as a guide:
 * 
 * In every file that has a role comparison like:
 *   currentUser?.role === 'manager'
 * 
 * It should be updated to:
 *   currentUser?.role === 'director'
 * 
 * This includes but is not limited to:
 * - src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
 * - src/pages/TaskDetail.tsx
 * - src/pages/TaskForm.tsx
 * - src/pages/TaskList.tsx
 * - src/pages/WorkScheduleConfig.tsx
 * 
 * Also, any UI references to 'Xerente' should be updated to 'Director'
 */

console.log(`
IMPORTANT: Update the following role-related code:

1. Replace all instances of:
   currentUser?.role === 'manager'
   with:
   currentUser?.role === 'director'

2. Replace all UI text instances of:
   'Xerente'
   with:
   'Director'

This needs to be done in all files referenced in the TypeScript errors.
